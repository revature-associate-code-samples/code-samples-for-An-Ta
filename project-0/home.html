                <li>First you will roll 2 dice.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your roll sum is a 7 or 11 you <strong>WIN</strong> woop woop!!!</li>
                        <li>If your roll sum is a 2, 3, or 12 that means you WIN twice!!! JK you <strong>LOSE</strong></li>
                        <li>Any other sum will be your <strong>POINT</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If you get a 7 well that just means your luck is not as good as mine and you <strong>LOSE</strong></li>
                        <li>However, if you roll your point again you <strong>WIN</strong> But your luck is still not as good as mine</li>
